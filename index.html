          <hr class="separator">
          <p>A nebula, also known as a nebula, is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and ionized gases. Originally, the nebula was the name of any diffuse celestial body, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for example, was attributed as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Melvin Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.</p>

            <hr class="separator">
            <p>Tycho Brahe was a Danish nobleman, astronomer, and writer known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical observations. He was born in the then-Danish peninsula of Scania. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He has been described as "the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts". Most of his observations were more accurate than the best available observations at the time.</p>
